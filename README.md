## Renewable-Energy-Forecasting-Project

# Overview
  This project focuses on forecasting renewable energy generation using time series data. The goal is to predict future unseen values of renewable energy generation using an XGBoost Regressor model.

# Data
 The project uses a CSV file containing time series data of renewable energy generation. The dataset includes features such as date, time, and energy generation values.

# Model
 The XGBoost Regressor model is used to train on the historical data and predict future energy generation values. The model is chosen for its ability to handle time series data effectively and provide accurate forecasts.

# Usage
- Data Preparation: Ensure the CSV file containing the time series data is in the correct format.
- Model Training: Run the provided Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the XGBoost Regressor model on the data.
- Prediction: Use the trained model to predict future energy generation values.
- Model Saving: Save the trained model using pickle for future use.
  
# Results
  The project aims to achieve accurate predictions of renewable energy generation values, which can be used for planning and optimization purposes.

# Future Improvements
- Explore other machine learning models for comparison.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters of the XGBoost Regressor for better performance.
